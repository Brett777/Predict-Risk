About
-----

LendingClub connects investors with borrows over the web, passing the savings of
a branchless bank on to its customers. LendingClub has funded roughly \$27B in
loans since its inception, but despite their ongoing success, CFO Tom Casey
predicts loses in 2017 to be between \$69 - \$84 million.

Problem
-------

Central to LendingClub’s success is approving the right loans for the right
people at the right rates. But loans issued in 2016 have already resulted in
\$157 million in charge-offs. Reducing charge-offs benefits both investors and
borrows; well designed predictive model could help to significantly reduce
charge-offs and losses.
